## My Notes for class 2 ( Make a Thing ) : (01/22/2027)

**My First Game in Bitsy (A Painful Yet Rewarding Experience)**

When I first heard about Bitsy, I assumed it would be a smooth experience with a minimal learning curve. I thought I could just be creative and instantly create a game. However, I completely misjudged it.

**Game: Meow Rush**  
**What It's About:** A cat tries to collect treats and escape from a cruel dog before it gets caught and reported to its owner.

**Challenges (Not Just One, Haha)**  
Even though my game was fairly basic, I thought, "Why not add a lot of hurdles to make it more challenging for players?" Unfortunately, this ended up becoming a hurdle for me instead.

Bitsy is a small engine, not designed for games with many dynamic reactions. Creating an enemy that follows my player was an absolute nightmare. The breakthrough came when I realized that I needed to use hacks for these types of interactions. Thanks to Borsky, I could add built-in hacks and even integrate JavaScript for additional features. However, using hacks can come with glitches, so be warned!

Here’s the link to that fantastic website for you to check out: [Borsky](http://andrewyolland.com/borksy/). Thanks to Andrew, I was able to create my game! 
Along with this the tutroials by [DanCox](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXuD3kyVEr5sF4iM2CszNt-fSVZDqxUm&si=EuI6v0pqoVQdmq7Y) also helped me to grasp some of the basics of Bitsy .

**Moving on to My Initial Expectations:**  
When I say complicated, I mean the following features I intended to include:
- An enemy that follows my cat
- A stopwatch to increase pressure and difficulty
- Multiple secret rooms (I created one, including secret portals to the same room)
- Blackouts (I ultimately decided against this, as it would make my players too anxious)
- Color-coded dialogues

**One Major Reflection:** It’s okay to leave some things behind, even though it's disappointing. I may not be a pro at time management, but I can easily focus on what matters, so from the above ideas, I opted to concentrate on the main elements.

**Back to My Challenges:**  
In the last class, when Professor Matt discussed a peer’s journal, I noticed a paragraph where the person explained why they chose Pico-8: the color selector  in Bitsy is extremely frustrating.

A lot of changes had to be made in the game data just to manipulate the code. This is all about the challenges; now let’s focus on what we were able to achieve: a two-level game with increasing complexity. 
The first level is designed so that the cat needs to collect all four treats before unlocking the door, but there are invisible portals to a mystery room. One drawback of the game is that the dog follows the cat, but the game-over screen only appears if the cat collides with the dog. In the second level, the cat is met by two aggressive dogs. I think the speed at which the dogs chase is extremely fast, making it very hard to complete this level, but I might change it later.

Here are a couple of screenshots of the levels of my game (Will add soon , some path errors!)
